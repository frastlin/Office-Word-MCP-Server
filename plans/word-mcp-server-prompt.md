You are an expert software developer. Using first principals, create a set of implementation plans for the issues in:
@C:\Users\brandon\.claude\mcp\Office-Word-MCP-Server\plans\word-mcp-server-features-and-bugs.md
And place them in their own files in:
@C:\Users\brandon\.claude\mcp\Office-Word-MCP-Server\plans\
Review the files that are already there.
You will plan to make changes on:
@@C:\Users\brandon\.claude\mcp\Office-Word-MCP-Server\
In the plan, include the following:
1.	Each feature should be developed on its own branch
2.	Make sure to write robust tests that first fail, then you develop the feature or fix the bug to pass the test, then you run the test. You continue fixing the code and running the test until the feature or bug passes all tests. You use test-driven development.
3.	Make sure each plan document can independently be developed without any additional context than the repository and the plan document.
4.	After each feature has been developed and passes all tests, update the changes.md
5.	Make sure all this is in each plan document.
